Traffic Sign Recognition Using Deep Learning

Introduction
------------
Traffic sign recognition is a crucial component of intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles. The ability to automatically detect and classify traffic signs from images helps improve road safety and enables advanced driver assistance systems. This project implements a deep learning-based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify traffic sign images into their respective categories.

Objectives
----------
- Develop a robust model that can accurately classify traffic signs from images.
- Preprocess and organize a large dataset of traffic sign images for training and testing.
- Evaluate the model’s performance and visualize its learning progress.

Dataset
-------
The dataset consists of traffic sign images organized into folders by class. Each class represents a specific type of traffic sign (e.g., speed limit, stop, turn right). The dataset is split into training and test sets:
- Training Set: Used to train the CNN model. Images are stored in data/Train/, with subfolders for each class.
- Test Set: Used to evaluate the model’s generalization. Images are stored in data/Test/.
Additional metadata is provided in CSV files (Train.csv, Test.csv, Meta.csv) containing image paths and class labels.

Methodology
-----------
Data Preprocessing:
- Images are resized to 32x32 pixels and normalized to have pixel values between 0 and 1.
- Data augmentation techniques (rotation, zoom, shear, shift) are applied to improve model robustness.
- The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow’s ImageDataGenerator for efficient batch processing.

Model Architecture:
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is designed to extract features from images and classify them.
- The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
- The output layer uses softmax activation to predict the probability of each class.

Training:
- The model is trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.
- Training is performed for 15 epochs with a batch size of 32.
- Training and validation accuracy/loss are monitored and plotted to visualize learning progress.

Evaluation:
- The trained model is evaluated on the test set to measure its accuracy and loss.
- Predictions are made on individual images using a dedicated prediction script.
- The model’s performance is analyzed using confusion matrices and classification reports.

Results
-------
- The model achieved good accuracy on both training and test sets, demonstrating its ability to classify traffic signs.
- Training and validation accuracy/loss plots show steady improvement and convergence.
- The model was able to correctly classify most test images, with some misclassifications due to challenging cases or limited training epochs.

Applications
------------
- Autonomous vehicles and driver assistance systems for real-time traffic sign recognition.
- Road safety analysis and monitoring.
- Educational tools for traffic sign learning.

Conclusion
----------
This project successfully implemented a deep learning-based traffic sign recognition system. The CNN model demonstrated strong performance in classifying traffic signs from images. Future improvements could include using more advanced architectures, increasing training epochs, and expanding the dataset for even better accuracy.
